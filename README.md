# Cuputer graphics project 
### Damian Brom

### Description 
This Project target is to implement some kind of graphical processing algorithm using a Raspberry Pi based RC car with a build in camera.
The current options are: SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping), following directed path and avoiding obstacles.
